#Füdi
*prounced 'foodie'*

###What's this?###
Füdi hopes to offer a community where people can just post and comment on cool as pictures of food they've eaten, tasted, wish they tasted, or were just close enough to food to take a pic.

It's a full-stack app, initially built with (see future dev or iterations dev for more info on current state) a PostgreSQL backend, Nodejs, Express, and EJS-layouts, with Bootstrap4 as the styling CSS-library, CSS3, HTML5, JS, and jQuery.

###Motivation###
Get crack-a-lackin'!  Yeah yeah, I seemed to always have found myself in kitchens, but basically this app exists because I like food, looking at food, and my girl and I spitballed this app out while talking about food.

I'm a newer coder, and friends and I need more X-P, and it could turn out to be a cool tool.
