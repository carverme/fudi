#Füdi
*prounced 'foodie'*

###What's this?###
Füdi hopes to offer a community where people can just post and comment on cool as pictures of food they've eaten, tasted, wish they tasted, or were just close enough to food to take a pic.

It's a full-stack app, initially built with (see future dev or iterations dev for more info on current state) a PostgreSQL backend, Nodejs, Express, and EJS-layouts, with Bootstrap4 as the styling CSS-library, CSS3, HTML5, JS, and jQuery.

###Motivation###
Get crack-a-lackin'!  Yeah yeah, I seemed to always have found myself in kitchens, but basically this app exists because I like food, looking at food, and my girl and I spitballed this app out while talking about food.

I'm a newer coder, and friends and I need more X-P, and it could turn out to be a cool tool.


###User Stories###
Let's say we have Matt:  He says, you know what'd be cool?  An app you can just post pics of food, like Insta someone says, but no, a collection of foods, out an about, and in your house, where you can focus on the food, the restaurant, follow the chef, or get a recipe.  Matt posts a three pics of food, from three different places, and each gets comments, and can get tagged, if you want Matt can share his favorite pic to his insta, through insta oauth. What. Whoa.

Matt knows no one else.
